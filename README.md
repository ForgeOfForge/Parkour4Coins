The **Parkour4Coins Mod** has received *a ton* of updates! Consider this your Skyblock parkour update!

**__What's new:__**
**Ghosts**: When you set a new personal best on any course, a ghost will be saved of that time. Next time you run that course you'll see your best time path in the form of fire particles. You can also share these ghost files and race against other players' best times! See #üèÜpb-alley  for more info

**New checkpoint sounds**: The default sound is the same, but if you stand on a starting plate for ~10 seconds the checkpoint and finish sounds will change. This preference is saved between sessions. There are currently three sound packs to choose from

**Split Times**: Your best times are saved and will still exist even if you close and reopen the game! Every time you reach a checkpoint the number at the end of the checkpoint message and in the top-right of your screen will update with a number showing you how many milliseconds you are ahead or behind your best run

**Movement Speed Tracker**: Your movement speed is displayed in the top-right of the screen. (100% = vanilla walk speed, so the percentage should reflect your movement speed stat fairly accurately.)

This is admittedly a bit sloppy on the code front, but it should work alright. If you experience any bugs, performance issues, or crashes please let me know!
