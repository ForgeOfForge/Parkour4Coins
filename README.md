The **Parkour4Coins Mod** has received *a ton* of updates! Consider this your Skyblock parkour update!

**__What's new:__**
**Ghosts**: When you set a new personal best on any course, a ghost will be saved of that time. Next time you run that course you'll see your best time path in the form of fire particles. You can also share these ghost files and race against other players' best times! See #üèÜpb-alley  for more info

**New checkpoint sounds**: The default sound is the same, but if you stand on a starting plate for ~10 seconds the checkpoint and finish sounds will change. This preference is saved between sessions. There are currently three sound packs to choose from

**Split Times**: Your best times are saved and will still exist even if you close and reopen the game! Every time you reach a checkpoint the number at the end of the checkpoint message and in the top-right of your screen will update with a number showing you how many milliseconds you are ahead or behind your best run

**Movement Speed Tracker**: Your movement speed is displayed in the top-right of the screen. (100% = vanilla walk speed, so the percentage should reflect your movement speed stat fairly accurately.)

You can now use /parkourstart and /parkourend to set up simulated checkpoints. The mod will automatically start a timer when you are within one block of the start and displays the finish time when you are within one block of the end. This means you can accurately and consistently test different routes anywhere on a parkour course. The blocks marked as the start/end will have fire particles above them while active.


Commands:
/parkoursound - Cycles the parkour checkpoint/finish sound. No need to stand on the start plate
/parkourghost - Toggles if the best-time ghost is displayed. Your ghost will still be recorded (default: true)
/parkoursplits - Toggles if your best splits are shown when you start a course (default: false)
/parkourhud - Toggles if the split time/speed hud is displayed in the top-right (default: true)
/parkourspawn - Warps you to your island and then pulls up the visit menu after a delay. This will reduce the number of times you get errors from attempting to warp too quickly

Want to see what it would be like if parkour checkpoints registered instantly instead of every half second? Just type /parkourinstant
